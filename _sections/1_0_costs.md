An infrastructure deficit framing gives a shared etiology to many technical and social harms in scientific work that are typically treated separately, and allows us to problematize other symptoms have become embedded as norms.

I will list some of the present costs to give a sense of the scale of need, as well as scope for the problems we intend to address here. These lists are grouped into rough and overlapping categories, but make no pretense at completeness and have no particular order.

Impacts on the **daily experience** of researchers include:

* A prodigious duplication and dead-weight loss of labor as each lab, and sometimes each person within each lab, will reinvent basic code, tools, and practices from scratch. Literally it is the inefficiency of the [Harberger's triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadweight_loss#Harberger's_triangle) in the supply and demand system for scientific infrastructure caused by inadequate supply. Labs with enough resources are forced to pay from other parts of their grants to hire professional programmers and engineers to build the infrastructure for their lab[^usuallyjusttheirs], but most just operate on a purely amateur basis. Many PhD students will spend the first several years of their degree re-solving already-solved problems, chasing the tails of the wrong half-readable engineering whitepapers, in their 6th year finally discovering the technique that they actually needed all along. That's not an educational or training model, it's the effect of displacing the undone labor of unbuilt infrastructure on vulnerable graduate workers almost always paid poverty wages.
* At least the partial cause of the phenomenon where "every scientist needs to be a programmer now" as people who aren't particularly interested in being programmers --- which is *fine* and *normal* --- need to either suffer through code written by some other unlucky amateur or learn an entire additional discipline in order to do the work of the one they chose.
* A great deal of pain and alienation for early- career researchers not previously trained in programming before being thrown in the deep end. Learning data hygeine practices like backup, annotation, etc. "the hard way" through some catastrophic loss is accepted myth in much of science. At some scale all the very real and widespread pain, guilt, and shame felt by people who had little choice but to reinvent their own data management system must be recognized as an infrastructural, rather than a personal problem.
* The high cost of "openness" and the dearth of data transparency. It is still rare to publish full, raw data and analysis code, often because the labor of cleaning it is too great. The "Open science" movement, roughly construed, has reached a few hard limits from present infrastructure that have forced its energy to leak from the sides as bullying leaderboards or sets of symbols that are mere signifiers of cultural affiliation to openness. "Openness" is not a uniform or universal goal for all science, but for those for whom it makes sense, we need to provide the appropriate tooling before insisting on a change in scientific norms. We can't expect data transparency from researchers while it is still so *hard.*


Impacts on the **system of scientific inquiry** include:

* A profoundly leaky knowledge acquisition system where entire PhDs worth of data can be lost and rendered useless when a student leaves a lab and no one remembers how to access the data or how it's formatted. 
* The inevitability of continual replication crises because it is often literally impossible to replicate an experiment that is done on a rig that was built one time, used entirely in-lab code, and was never documented
* Reliance on communication platforms and knowledge systems that aren't designed to, and don't come close to satisfying the needs of scientific communication. In the absence of some generalized means of knowledge organization, scientists ask the void[^whichvoid] for advice or guidance from anyone that algorithmically stumbles by. Often our best recourse is to make a Slack about it, which is incapable of producing a public, durable, and cumulative resource: and so the same questions will be asked again... and again...
* A perhaps doomed intellectual endeavor[^solaris] as we attempt to understand the staggering complexity of the brain by peering at it through the camera obscura of just the most recent data you or your lab have collected rather than being able to index across the many measurements of the same phenomena. The unnecessary reduplication of experiments becomes not just a methodological limitation, but an ethical catastrophe as researchers have little choice but to abandon the elemental principle of sacrificing as few animals as possible. 
* A near-absence of semantic or topical organization of research that makes cumulative progress in science proabilistic at best, and subject to the malformed incentives of publication and prestige gathering at worst. Since engaging with prior literature is a matter of manually reconstructing a caricature of a field of work in every introduction, continuing lines of inquiry or responding to conflicting results is *strictly optional.* 
* A hierarchy of prestige that devalues the labor of many groups of technicians, animal care workers, and so on. Authorship is the coin of the realm, but many workers that are fundamental to the operation of science only receive the credit of an acknowledgement. We need a system to value and assign credit for the immense amount of technical and practical knowledge and labor they contribute.

Impacts on the relationship between **science and society**:

* An insular system where the inaccessibility of all the "contextual" knowledge {% cite woolKnowledgeNetworksHow2020 barleyBackroomsScienceWork1994 %} that doesn't have a venue for sharing but is necessary to perform experiments, like "how to build this apparatus," "what kind of motor would work here," etc. is a force that favors established and well-funded labs who can rely on local knowledege and hiring engineers/etc. and excludes new, lesser-funded labs at non-ivy institutions. The concentration of technical knowledge magnifies the inequity of strongly skewed funding distributions such that the most well-funded labs can do a completely different kind of science than the rest of us, turning the positive-feedback loop of funding begetting funding ever faster.
* An absconscion with the public resources we are privileged enough to receive, where rather than returning the fruits of the many technical challenges we are tasked with solving to the public in the form of data, tools, collected practical knowledge, etc. we largely return papers. Since those papers are often impenetrable outside of their discipline or paywalled outside of academia, we multiply the above impacts of labor duplication and knowledge inaccessibility by the scale of society. 
* The complicity of scientists in rendering our collective intellectual heritage nothing more than another regiment in the ever-advancing armies of [platform capitalism](#platforms-industry-capture-and-the-profit-motive). If our highest aspirations are to shunt all our experiments, data, and analysis tools onto Amazon Web Services, our failure of imagination will be responsible for yet another obligate funnel of wealth into the system of extractive platforms that dominate the flow of global information. For ourselves, we stand to have the practice of science filleted at the seams into a series of mutually incompatible subscription services. For society, we squander the chance for one of the very few domains of non-economic labor to build systems to recollectivize the basic infrastrucutre of the internet: rather than providing an alternative to the information overlords and their digital enclosure movement, we will be run right into their arms.

Considered separately, these are serious problems, but together they are a damning indictment of our role as stewards of our corner of the human knowledge project. 

We arrive at this situation not because scientists are lazy and incompetent, but because we are embedded in a system of mutually reinforcing disincentives to cumulative infrastructure development. Our incentive systems are, in turn, coproductive with a raft of economically powerful entities that would really prefer owning it all themselves, thanks. Put bluntly, "we are dealing with a massively entrenched set of institutions, built around the last information age and fighting for its life" {% cite bowkerInformationInfrastructureStudies2010 %}

There is, of course, an enormous amount of work being done by researchers and engineers on all of these problems, and a huge amount of progress has been made on them. My intention is not to shame or devalue anyone's work, but to try and describe a path towards integrating it and making it mutually reinforcing.

Before proposing a potential solution to some of the above problems, it is important to motivate why they haven't already been solved, or why their solution is not necessarily imminent. To do that, we need a sense of the social and technical challenges that structure the development of our tools.

[^solaris]: > ...  the recording instruments registered a profusion of signals - fragmentary indications of some outlandish activity, which in fact defeated all attempts at analysis. Did these data point to a momentary condition of stimulation, or to regular impulses correlated with the gigantic structures which the ocean was in the process of creating elsewhere, at the antipodes of the region under investigation? Had the electronic apparatus recorded the cryptic manifestation of the ocean's ancient secrets? Had it revealed its innermost workings to us? Who could tell? No two reactions to the stimuli were the same. Sometimes the instruments almost exploded under the violence of the impulses, sometimes there was total silence; it was impossible to obtain a repetition of any previously observed phenomenon. Constantly, it seemed, the experts were on the brink of deciphering the ever-growing mass of information. Was it not, after all, with this object in mind that computers had been built of virtually limitless capacity, such as no previous problem had ever demanded?
	>
	> And, indeed, some results were obtained. The ocean as a source of electric and magnetic impulses and of gravitation expressed itself in a more or less mathematical language. Also, by calling on the most abstruse branches of statistical analysis, it was possible to classify certain frequencies in the discharges of current. Structural homologues were discovered, not unlike those already observed by physicists in that sector of science which deals with the reciprocal interaction of energy and matter, elements and compounds, the finite and the infinite. This correspondence convinced the scientists that they were confronted with a monstrous entity endowed with reason, a protoplasmic ocean-brain enveloping the entire planet and idling its time away in extravagant theoretical cognitation about the nature of the universe. Our instruments had intercepted minute random fragments of a prodigious and everlasting monologue unfolding in the depths of this colossal brain, which was inevitably beyond our understanding.
	
	> So much for the mathematicians. These hypotheses, according to some people, underestimated the resources of the human mind; they bowed to the unknown, proclaiming the ancient doctrine, arrogantly resurrected, of ignoramus et ignorabimus. Others regarded the mathematicians' hypotheses as sterile and dangerous nonsense, contributing towards the creation of a modern mythology based on the notion of this giant brain - whether plasmic or electronic was immaterial - as the ultimate objective of existence, the very synthesis of life.
	
	> Yet others… but the would-be experts were legion and each had his own theory. A comparison of the ‘contact' school of thought with other branches of Solarist studies, in which specialization had rapidly developed, especially during the last quarter of a century, made it clear that a Solarist-cybernetician had difficulty in making himself understood to a Solarist-symmetriadologist. Veubeke, director of the Institute when I was studying there, had asked jokingly one day: **"How do you expect to communicate with the ocean, when you can't even understand one another?"** The jest contained more than a grain of truth. [...]
	
	> Lifting the heavy volume with both hands, I replaced it on the shelf, and thought to myself that our scholarship, all the information accumulated in the libraries, amounted to a useless jumble of words, a sludge of statements and suppositions, and that we had not progressed an inch in the 78 years since researches had begun. The situation seemed much worse now than in the time of the pioneers, since the assiduous efforts of so many years had not resulted in a single indisputable conclusion. "

[^googlepatent]: A patent from Google is telling about how they view privacy concerns: whatever we can't get explicitly, we'll infer to sell better ads!
    > One possible method to improve ad targeting is for ad targeting systems to obtain and use user profiles. For example, user profiles may be determined using information voluntarily given by users (e.g., when they subscribe to a service). This user attribute information may then be matched against advertiser specified attributes of the ad (e.g., targeting criteria). Unfortunately, user profile information is not always available since many Websites (e.g., search engines) do not require subscription or user registration. Moreover, even when available, the user profile may be incomplete (e.g., because the information given at the time of subscription may be limited to what is needed for the service and hence not comprehensive, because of privacy considerations, etc.). Furthermore, advertisers may need to manually define user profile targeting information. In addition, even if user profile information is available, advertisers may not be able to use this information to target ads effectively. {% cite bharatGeneratingUserInformation2005 %}

[^wikiwording]: Interestingly, this quote is almost, but not exactly the same as that on [Ward's wiki](http://wiki.c2.com/?WhyWikiWorks): 
	> So that's it - insecure, indiscriminate, user-hostile, slow, full of difficult, nit-picking people, and frivolous. Any other online community would count each of these strengths as a terrible flaw. Perhaps wiki works because the other online communities do not.

	> Cunningham had developed a database to collect the contributions of the listserv members. He had noticed that the content of the listserv tended to get buried, and therefore the most recent post might be under-informed about posts which came before it. The way around this problem was to collect ideas in a database, and then edit those ideas rather than begin anew with each listserv posting. Cunningham’s post states that “The plan is to have interested parties write web pages about the People, Projects and Patterns that have changed the way they program. Short stories that hint at patterns are welcome too.” As to the rhetorical expectations, Cunningham added “The writing style is casual, like email or netnews, but doesn't have to be so repetitive since the things being discussed don't disappear. Think of it as a moderated list where anyone can be moderator and everything is archived. It's not quite a chat, still, conversation is possible.” - {% cite cummingsWhatWasWikiWhy2009 %}

	>
	> A1: I don't know of any such wiki merge, nor of any discussion of the history of all wikis. Such a discussion should probably reside (if created) on MeatballWiki.

[^sparqldb]: Tim Berners-Lee describes the distinction between traditional relationship databases and RDF databases:
    >  Relational database systems, manage RDF data, but in a specialized way. In a table, there are many records with the same set of properties. An individual cell (which corresponds to an RDF property) is not often thought of on its own. SQL queries can join tables and extract data from tables, and the result is generally a table. So, the practical use for which RDB software is used typically optimized for soing operations with a small number of tables some of which may have a large number of elements.
    > 
    > RDB systems have datatypes at the atomic (unstructured) level, as RDF and XML will/do. Combination rules tend in RDBs to be loosely enforced, in that a query can join tables by any comlumns which match by datatype -- without any check on the semantics. You could for example create a list of houses that have the same number as rooms as an employee's shoe size, for every employee, even though the sense of that would be questionable.
    > 
    > The Semantic Web is not designed just as a new data model - it is specifically appropriate to the linking of data of many different models. One of the great things it will allow is to add information relating different databases on the Web, to allow sophisticated operations to be performed across them. https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/RDFnot.html

[^stratplan]: > Through its Biomedical Data Translator program, the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) is supporting research to develop ways to connect conventionally separated data types to one another to make them more useful for researchers and the public. The Translator aims to bring data types together in ways that will integrate multiple types of existing data sourcess, including objective signs and symptoms of disease, drug effects, and other types of biological data relevant to understanding the development of disease and how it progresses in patients. 


[^impossibledata]: > First, we assert that a single monolithic data set that directly connects the complete set of clinical characteristics to the complete set of biomolecular features, including “-omics” data, will never exist because the number of characteristics and features is constantly shifting and exponentially growing. Second, even if such a single monolithic data set existed, all-vs.-all associations will inevitably succumb to problems with statistical power (i.e., the curse of dimensionality).9 Such problems will get worse, not better, as more and more clinical and biomolecular data are collected and become available. We also assert that there is no single language, software or natural, with which to express clinical and biomolecular observations—these observations are necessarily and appropriately linked to the measurement technologies that produce them, as well as the nuances of language. The lack of a universal language for expressing clinical and biomolecular observations presents a risk of isolation or marginalization of data that are relevant for answering a particular inquiry, but are never accessed because of a failure in translation. 
    >
    > Based on these observations, our final assertion is that automating the ability to reason across integrated data sources and providing users who pose inquiries with a dossier of translated answers coupled with full provenance and confidence in the results is critical if we wish to accelerate clinical and translational insights, drive new discoveries, facilitate serendipity, improve clinical-trial design, and ultimately improve clinical care. This final assertion represents the driving motivation for the Translator system. {% cite consortiumUniversalBiomedicalData2019 %}

[^federatedterminology]: There is a lot of subtlety to the terminology surrounding "federated" and the typology of distributed systems generally, I am using it in the federated messaging sense of forming groups of people, rather than the strict term "federated databases" which do imply a standardized schema across a federation. The conception of distributed, autonomous databases described by the DataLad team {% cite hankeDefenseDecentralizedResearch2021 %} is a bit closer to my meaning. In the ActivityPub world, federations refer to a single homeserver under which many people can sign up. We mean something similar but distinct: people that have autonomous "homeservers" in a peer to peer system, typically multiple identities for a single person rather than many people on a single server, that can combine into federations with particular governance structures and technological systems attached.

[^chainz]: In reality, without any form of distributed uniqueness checking, we would need to have some notion of where this username is "from," so let's say we actually have a system like `username@name-provider` but for this example assume a single name provider, we'll return to identity provision.

[^whypseudo]: We could use actual turtle or JSON-LD syntax throughout, but I am using a simplified pseudocode to a) make it a bit more readable for the sake of illustration and b) be very explicit that this is not intended to be a proposal for a protocol or specification, but demonstrative of its qualities.

    >
    > Therefore, you will find pointers in hypertext which point to documents which never change but you will also find pointers to documents which change with time. You will find pointers to documents which are available in more than one format. You will find pointers to documents which look different depending on who is asking for them. There are ways to describe in a machine or human readable way exactly what sort of repeatability you would expect from a URI, but the architecture of the Web is that that is for something for the owner of the URI to determine. https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Axioms.html

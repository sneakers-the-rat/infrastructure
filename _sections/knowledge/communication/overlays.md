#### Overlays & Adversarial Interoperability

We can't expect the entire practice of academic publishing to transition to cell-based text editors in a p2p linked data swarm anytime soon. In the same way that we discussed frameworks for integrating heterogeneous analytical and experimental tools, we need some means of **bridging** communication tools and **overlays** for interacting with existing communication formats. There are many examples of bridging communication protocols, eg. the [many ways to use Matrix](https://matrix.org/bridges/) with [Slack](https://matrix.org/bridges/#slack), [email](https://matrix.org/bridges/#email), [Signal](https://matrix.org/bridges/#signal), etc. The overlays for websites, pdfs, and other more static media that we'll discuss are means to bring them into the system whether they support it or not: our interoperability should be willing to be adversarial if it needs to be {% cite doctorowAdversarialInteroperabilityReviving2019 doctorowAdversarialInteroperability2019 %}. In representing the intrinsically interactive and social nature of reading (eg. see {% cite jacksonMarginaliaReadersWriting2001 %}), overlays as interfaces also supplement the "horizontal" connections between cells by injecting information into them or transcluding it elsewhere: creating a fuzzy boundary between writing *on* something vs *about* something. 

We don't need to look far to find a well-trod interface for annotation overlays for document-like media: the humble highlighter. [Hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is), enabled on this page, lets readers highlight and annotate any webpage with a [browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hypothesis-web-pdf-annota/bjfhmglciegochdpefhhlphglcehbmek) or javascript bookmarklet. This interface is a near match to the highlighting and review tools of Microsoft Word and Google Docs used for the same purpose. At its heart is a system for making anchors, references to specific places in a text, and the means of matching them even when the text changes or the reference is ambiguous {% cite csillagFuzzyAnchoring2013 %}. For example, [this anchor](https://hypothes.is/a/oLw4uk7_Eeyt5N-FVlE3fw) has three features, a `RangeSelector` that anchors it given the position within the paragraph, an absolute `TextPositionSelector`, and a contextual `TextQuoteSelector` that you can see with an [API call](https://api.hypothes.is/api/annotations/oLw4uk7_Eeyt5N-FVlE3fw). Anchors like these, along with references to the [code that resolves them](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/blob/fb08cdf38191643d7a35d84ca3b822589c2e880a/src/annotator/anchoring/types.js), could be the objects to which we could link from the rest of our communication system.

On its own, it serves to give a `Talk:` page to every website. With an integration into a system of linked data and identity, it also serves as a means of extending the notion of bidirectional transclusion described above to work that is not explicitly formatted for it. Most scientific work is represented as `.pdf`s rather than `.html` pages, and hypothes.is [already supports](https://web.hypothes.is/help/annotating-locally-saved-pdfs/) annotating PDFs. With an integration into pdf reading software, for example [Zotero's PDF reader](https://www.zotero.org/support/pdf_reader_preview), there would be a relatively low barrier to integrating collaborative annotation into existing workflows and practices.

Digital publishing makes imagining the social regulation of science as a much more broadly based and continuous process much easier, but the problem of moderation remains (as it has since at least the coiner of the terms "Gold" and "Green" open access lost faith in ahierarchical scientific communication after someone said poo-poo words at him on Internet while defending the use of they/them as gender-ambiguous pronouns {% cite harnadSkyWriting1987 harnadScholarlySkywritingPrepublication1990 ellisBooksTranslationWanted1986 %}). Some movement has been made towards public peer review: eLife has integrated hypothes.is since 2016 {% cite ELifePartnersHypothes2016 %}, and bioRxiv had decided to integrate it as well in 2017 {% cite dwhlyBioRxivSelectsHypothesis2017 %} before getting cold feet about the genuinely hard problem of moderation (among others {% cite heatherstainesPreprintServicesGather2018 %}) and instead adopting the more publisher-friendly TRiP system of refereed peer-reviews {% cite nateangellAnnouncingTRiPTransparent2019 %}.

Overlays raise basic questions about control over the representation of our work, about who is able to write what on it. As with potential incompatibility between interfaces, we should be able to control what comments appear *on* our work, but there is no way to control -- even in our current communication systems -- what someone says *about* it. Our system gives us some ability to identify bad actors and regulate the avenues of communication without overcorrecting into a system where criticism becomes impossible -- even if we don't want to represent someone's comments on our work, it is possible to make them and for others to find them, but it's also possible to contextualize their context if they're made in bad faith. 

Though a description of the norms and tools needed to maintain healthy public annotation is impossible here, our system *provides a space for having that conversation.* Authors could, for example, allow the display of annotations from a professional society like `@sfn` that has a code of conduct and moderation team, or annotations associated with comments on `@pubpeer`, or from a looser organization of colleagues and other `@neurofriends`. Conversely, being able to make annotations and comments from different federations gives us a rough proxy to different registers of communication and preserves the plurality of our expression. Social tools like these are in the hypothes.is team's [development roadmap](https://web.archive.org/web/20211015213849/https://github.com/hypothesis/product-backlog/projects/6), but I intend it as a well-developed and mature example of a general type of technology[^genius] rather than a recommendation. 

In addition to annotating other works, overlays can come in the form of bots or other tools for interacting with existing systems in a way that's compatible with a new one. One particularly impressive example of aggressive interoperability in this domain is Eduardo ["flancian"](https://flancia.org/) Ivanec's [agora](https://anagora.org/) {% cite ivanecFutureNoteTaking2021 velitchkovPersonalKnowledgeGraphs %}. An agora is a [wiki-like](https://anagora.org/wiki-like) project with pages (or nodes) for each named concept, but it also allows for multiple representations of a given node: so notes from multiple people across multiple mediums will be present on the same page. Accompanying the agora is the anagora bot (on [Mastodon](https://botsin.space/@agora) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/an_agora)), which makes links to, and backlinks from pages mentioned as `[[wikilinks]]` by accounts that follow them (for example: a [post](https://social.coop/@jonny/108621001205679783), the bot's [reply](https://botsin.space/@agora/108621001318792297), and one of the linked pages, [`[[wikilinks everywhere]]`](https://anagora.org/Wikilinks+Everywhere)). This becomes natural quickly: it's common for people associated with the agora (or [flancians](https://flancia.org/manifesto/)) to speak with wikilinks, or index links and conversations that they come across for mutual discovery.

The agora makes linked annotation a basic part of using the web without requiring fundamental changes in communication practices. The agora is an exercise in radically permissive protocol-like thinking: rather than creating a new app or platform, theoretically any bot could be made to crawl different mediums for wikilinks and index them. It illustrates that interfaces can precede formal protocols and serve as a testing and development ground for them.

Another bridging overlay for more author-focused scientific communication would be to explicitly archive the threads that increasingly serve as companions to published work --- or original works of scholarship on their own (eg. {% cite bostonNeedKnowInformationSeeking2022 %}). I have started experimenting with this with the [`@threadodo_bot`](https://twitter.com/threadodo_bot), a bot that converts a thread to a PDF[^markdowntoo] and uploads it to Zenodo when it is tagged beneath one. This bot is being programmed as a [generalizable framework for bots](https://github.com/sneakers-the-rat/threadodo/blob/58d5f13f88728babdf2da0b34310c88349725566/threadodo/actions/commands.py#L145-L168) that can accept parameterized commands. For example, someone can set their authorship information by tweeting "[identify](https://twitter.com/json_dirs/status/1542305909983936512)" at threadodo, which accepts a series of key-value pairs to set your name, affiliation, and orcid. Future versions will support automatic reference generation for linked works, including previously archived threads, as well as setting prefixes for OWL schema for use in semantic `[[predicate::object]]` wikilinks.

When some recognizably different communication medium begins to coalesce, it should support bidirectional *crossposting* to and from existing mediums. Crossposting substantially eases transition --- for example between [Twitter and Mastodon](https://crossposter.masto.donte.com.br/) --- as patterns of usage that have been trained for years on hyperoptimized attention-capturing platforms are hard to break. Together with bridges, bots, and overlays for annotation, linking, and archiving, the dream of rewriting the norms of academic communication looks less like some "if you build it they will come" pipe dream and more like a transitional period of demonstrating what we can dream of together. Adversarial interoperability not only *works* {% cite doctorowAdversarialInteroperability2019 %}, it's also a gift of the [hacker mindset](https://www.gwern.net/Unseeing) that teaches us how to make building a better world an act of unrepentant *joy.*

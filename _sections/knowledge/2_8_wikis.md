> If we take radical collaboration as our core, then it becomes clear that extending Wikipedia’s success doesn’t simply mean installing more copies of wiki software for different tasks. It means figuring out the key principles that make radical collaboration work. What kinds of projects is it good for? How do you get them started? How do you keep them growing? What rules do you put in place? What software do you use? {% cite swartzMakingMoreWikipedias2006 %}

> So that's it --- insecure but reliable, indiscriminate and subtle, user hostile yet easy to use, slow but up to date, and full of difficult, nit-picking people who exhibit a remarkable community camaraderie. Confused? Any other online community would count each of these "negatives" as a terrible flaw, and the contradictions as impossible to reconcile. Perhaps wiki works because the other online communities don't. {% cite leufWikiWayQuick2001a -l 329 %} and in [WhyWikiWorks](http://wiki.c2.com/?WhyWikiWorks)[^wikiwording]


Aside from maybe the internet itself, there is no larger public digital knowledge organization effort than Wikipedia. While there are many lessons to be learned from Wikipedia itself, it emerged from a prior base of thought and experimentation in radically permissive, self-structuring read/write --- sometimes called "peer production" {% cite hillWikipediaEndOpen2019 %} --- communities. Wikis are now quasi-ubiquitous[^corporatewikis], perhaps largely thanks to Wikipedia, but its specific history and intent to be an *encyclopedia* entwines it with a very particular technological and social system that obscures some of the broader dreams of early wikis. 

Aaron Swartz recounts a quote from Jimmy Wales, co-founder of Wikipedia:

> “I’m not a wiki person who happened to go into encyclopedias,” Wales told the crowd at Oxford. “I’m an encyclopedia person who happened to use a wiki.” {% cite swartzWhoWritesWikipedia2006 %}

And further describes how this origin and mission differentiates it from other internet communities:

> But Wikipedia isn’t even a typical community. Usually Internet communities are groups of people who come together to discuss something, like cryptography or the writing of a technical specification. Perhaps they meet in an IRC channel, a web forum, a newsgroup, or on a mailing list, but the focus is always something “out there”, something outside the discussion itself.
> 
> But **with Wikipedia, the goal is building Wikipedia.** It’s not a community set up to make some other thing, it’s a community set up to make itself. And since Wikipedia was one of the first sites to do it, we know hardly anything about building communities like that. {% cite swartzMakingMoreWikipedias2006 %}

We know a lot more now than in 2006, of course, but Wikipedia still has outsized structuring influence on our beliefs about what Wikis can be. Wikipedia has since spawned a [large number](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Complete_list_of_Wikimedia_projects) of technologies and projects like [Wikidata](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikidata) and [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page), each with their own long and occasionally torrid histories. I won't dwell on the obvious and massive feat of collective organization that the greater Wikipedia project represents --- we should build on and interoperate with its projects and respect the amount of work the foundation and its editors have put in to preserve free access to information, but learning from its imperfections is more useful to us here, especially for things that aren't encyclopedias. The dream of a centralized, but mass-edited "encyclopedia of everything" seems to be waning, and its slow retreat from wild openness has run parallel to a long decline in contributors {% cite hillWikipediaEndOpen2019 halfakerRiseDeclineOpen2013 %}. Throughout that time, there has been a separate (and largely skeptical) set of wiki communities holding court on what a radically open web can be like, inventing their worlds in real time. These communities have histories that are continuous with one another, and in their mutual reaction and inspiration sometimes teach similar lessons from across the divides of their very different structure.

The first wiki was launched in 1995[^wikistart] ([it's still up](http://wiki.c2.com/)) and came to be known as Ward's wiki after its author [WardCunningham](http://wiki.c2.com/?WardCunningham). Technically, it was extremely simple: a handful of [TextFormattingRules](http://wiki.c2.com/?TextFormattingRules) and use of [WikiCase](http://wiki.c2.com/?WikiCase) where if you [JoinCapitalizedWords](http://wiki.c2.com/?JoinCapitalizedWords) you create a link to a (potentially new) [WikiPage](http://wiki.c2.com/?WikiPage) --- and the ability for anyone to edit any page. These very simple [WikiDesignPrinciples](http://wiki.c2.com/?WikiDesignPrinciples) led to a sprawling and continuous conversation that spanned more than a [decade](http://wiki.c2.com/?WardsWikiTenthAnniversary) and thousands[^npages] of pages that, because of the nature of the medium, is left fully preserved in amber. Those conversations are a history of thought on what makes wiki communities work (eg. [WhyWikiWorks](http://wiki.c2.com/?WhyWikiWorks), [WhyWikiWorksNot](http://wiki.c2.com/?WhyWikiWorksNot)), and what is needed to sustain them. 

[^npages]: [23,244](http://c2.com/wiki/history/) unique page names according to the edit history, but the edit history was also purposely pruned from time to time.

One tension that emerged early without satisfying resolution is the balance between "[DocumentMode](http://wiki.c2.com/?DocumentMode)" writing that serves as linearly-readable reference material, similar to that of Wikipedia, and "[ThreadMode](http://wiki.c2.com/?ThreadMode)" writing that is a nonlinear representation of a conversation. Order vs spontaneity is a fundamental challenge of inventing culture in plaintext. The purpose of using a wiki as opposed to other technologies that existed at the time like bulletin boards, newsgroups, IRC, etc. was that it provided a means of fluid structure[^wardcause]. The parallel need to communicate and attribute work made it a seeming inevitability that even if you went out of your way to restructure a lot of writing into a sensible DocumentMode page, someone would soon after create a new horizontal divider and start a fresh ThreadMode section.

Ward Cunningham and other more organizationally-oriented contributors opposed ThreadMode (eg. [ThreadModeConsideredHarmful](http://wiki.c2.com/?ThreadModeConsideredHarmful), [InFavorOfDissertation](http://wiki.c2.com/?InFavorOfDissertation)) for a number of reasons, largely due to the [ThreadMess](http://wiki.c2.com/?ThreadMess) and [WikiChaos](http://wiki.c2.com/?WikiChaos) it had the potential of creating. 

> I occasionally suggest how this site should be used. My [GoodStyle](http://wiki.c2.com/?GoodStyle) suggestions have been here since the beginning and are linked from the edit page should anyone forget. I have done my best to discourage dialog [InFavorOfDissertation](http://wiki.c2.com/?InFavorOfDissertation) which offers a better fit to this medium. I've been overruled. I will continue to make small edits to pages for the sake of brevity. -- [WardCunningham](http://wiki.c2.com/?WardCunningham) {% cite C2wikiWikiHistory %} 

Most pages are thus a combination of both, usually with some DocumentMode text at the top with ThreadMode conversations interspersed throughout without necessarily having any clean delineation between the two. Far from just being raw disorder, this mixed mode of writing gave it a peculiar character of being *both* a folk reference for a library of concepts *as well as* a history of discussion that made the contingency of that reference material plain. Beka Valentine put it well:

> c2wiki is an exercise in dialogical methods. of laying bare the fact that knowledge and ideas are not some truth delivered from On High, but rather a social process, a conversation, a dialectic, between various views and interests {% cite valentineC2wikiExerciseDialogical2021 %}

This tension and its surrounding discussions point to the need for multiple representations of a single idea: that both the social and reference representations of a concept are valuable, but aren't necessarily best served by being represented in the same place. There was relatively common understanding that the intended order of things was to have many ThreadMode conversations that would gradually be converted to DocumentMode in a process of [BrainStormFirstCleanLater](http://wiki.c2.com/?BrainStormFirstCleanLater). Many [proposed solutions](http://wiki.c2.com/?ConvertThreadModeToDocumentMode) orbit around making parallel pages with similar names (like \<pagename\>Discussion) to clean up a document while preserving the threads (though there were plenty of interesting alternatives, eg. [DialecticMode](http://wiki.c2.com/?DialecticMode))[^contemporarywikithought].

Wikipedia, in its attendant [WikiEngine](http://wiki.c2.com/?WikiEngines) [MediaWiki](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki), cut the Gordian Knot by splitting each page into a separate *Article* and *Talk* pages, with the talk page in its own **Namespace** -- eg. [Gordian_Knot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordian_Knot) vs [Talk:Gordian_Knot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Gordian_Knot). Talk pages resemble a lot of the energy of early wikis: disorganized, sometimes silly, sometimes angry, and usually charmingly pedantic. Namespaces extend the traditional "everything is a page" notion encoded in the WikiCase link system by giving different pages different roles. In addition to having parallel conversations on articles and talk pages, it is possible to have template pages that can be included on wiki pages with `{% raw %}{{double curly bracket}}{% endraw %}` syntax -- eg. [Template:Citation_Needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Citation_needed) renders `{% raw %}{{Citation needed}}{% endraw %}` as <sup><i>[citation needed]</i></sup>. Talk pages have their own **functional differentiation,** with features for threading and annotating discussions that aren't present on the main article pages (see [Wikipedia:Flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Flow) {% cite WikipediaFlow2021 %}). Generalized beyond the context of wikis, functional differentiation of a single item into its multiple representations is relatively common in computing: eg. this document exists as a [git repository](https://github.com/sneakers-the-rat/infrastructure), the <span id="gobackhere">[rendered page](/infrastructure/goback.html)</span>, a [pdf](/infrastructure/tex/decentralized_infrastructure_render.pdf), hypothes.is annotations, etc.

The complete segregation of discussion to Talk pages is driven by Wikipedia's exclusivity as an encyclopedia, with reminders that it is the "[sole purpose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Don't_lose_the_thread#Move_to_the_article_talk_page)" peppered throughout the rules and guidelines. The presence of messy subjective discussions would of course be discordant with the very austere and "neutral" articles of an encyclopedia. There are no visible indications that the talk pages even exist in the main text, and so even deeply controversial topics have no references to the conversations in talk pages that contextualize them --- despite this being a requested feature by both administrators and editors {% cite schneiderUnderstandingImprovingWikipedia2011 %}. 

Talk pages serve as one of the primary points of coordination and conflict resolution on Wikipedia, and also provide a low-barrier entrypoint for questions posed to a space they perceive to be "an approachable community of experts" {% cite viegasTalkYouType2007 %}. The separation of Talk pages and the [labyrinthine rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Talk_page_guidelines) governing their use function to obscure the dialogical and collective production of knowledge at the heart of wikis and Wikipedia. The body of thought that structures Wikipedia, most of which is in its [Wikipedia:\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal) namespace, is immense and extremely valuable, but is largely hidden except from those who care to look for it. Since Wikipedia is "always already there" often without trace of its massively collective nature, relatively few people ever contribute to it. Reciprocally, since acknowledging personal contribution is or point of view is [explicitly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research) against some of its [core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view) policies and [traditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid_thread_mode), there is little public credit outside the Wikipedia community itself for the labor of maintaining it. 

The forking of Wards Wikis into the first [SisterSites](http://wiki.c2.com/?SisterSites) teaches a parallel strain of lessons. Ward's Wiki started as a means of organizing knowledge for the Portland Pattern Repository[^wardinvite], a programming community (referred to as [DesignPatterns](http://wiki.c2.com/?DesignPatterns) below), and in 1998 they were overwhelmed with proponents of [ExtremeProgramming](http://wiki.c2.com/?ExtremeProgramming) (or XP), which caused the first fissure in the wiki:

> XP advocates seemed to be talking about XP at every possible opportunity and seemingly on every page with content the least bit related to software development. This annoyed a number people who were here to discuss patterns, leading to the tag [XpFreeZone](http://wiki.c2.com/?XpFreeZone), as a request not to talk about ExtremeProgramming on that page. 
>
> It was difficult to pick out the [DesignPatterns](http://wiki.c2.com/?DesignPatterns) discussion on [RecentChanges](http://wiki.c2.com/?RecentChanges)[^recentchanges], because most of the activity was related to ExtremeProgramming. Eventually, most of the [DesignPatterns](http://wiki.c2.com/?DesignPatterns) people left, to discuss patterns in a "quieter" environment, and people started referring to this site as [WardsWiki](http://wiki.c2.com/?WardsWiki) instead of the [PortlandPatternRepository](http://wiki.c2.com/?PortlandPatternRepository) {% cite C2wikiWikiHistory %}

One of the first and most influential Sister Sites was [Meatball Wiki](http://meatballwiki.org/), described on Wards Wiki:

> SunirShah founded MeatballWiki to absorb and enlarge the discussion of what wiki and wiki like sites might be. That discussion still simmers here. But here it can take on a negative tone sounding more like complaining. On meatball, under Sunir's careful leadership, the ideas, wild or not, stay amazingly upbeat. - [SisterSites](http://wiki.c2.com/?SisterSites)

MeatballWiki became the spiritual successor to Ward's Wiki, which at that point had its own momentum of culture less interested in being the repository of wiki thought[^meatballthought]. Meatball has its own prolific history of thought, including reflections on its very existence as a SisterSite. These were a series of discussions that melded thoughts from open source computing with social systems; in part: [RightToFork](http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/RightToFork), [RightToLeave](http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/RightToLeave), [EnlargeSpace](http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/EnlargeSpace), and [TransClusion](http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/TransClusion).

What can be done when the internal divisions in a wiki community and the weight of its history make healthy contribution impossible? The simplest is to exercise the [RightToLeave](http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/RightToLeave), as it is almost always possible to just stop being part of a digital community. This approach is clearly the most destructive, as it involves abandoning the emotional bonds of a community, prior work (see the [WikiMindWipe](http://wiki.c2.com/?WikiMindWipe) where a user left and took all their contributions with them), and doesn't necessarily provide an alternative that alleviates the cause of the tension. The next idea is to *fork* the community, where its body --- in the case of wikis the pages and history --- can be duplicated so that it can proceed along two parallel tracks. Exercising the right to fork is, according to Meatball, "people exercising their RightToLeave whilst maintaining their emotional stake" {% cite MeatballWikiRightToLeave %}.

The discussion around the Right to Fork on Meatball is far from uniformly positive, and is certainly colored by the strong presence of its [BenevolentDictator](http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/BenevolentDictator) Sunir Shah who viewed it as a last resort after all attempts at [ConflictResolution](http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/ConflictResolution) have failed. They point to the potentially damaging effects of a fork, like bitterness, disputes over content ownership (see [MeatballIsNotFree](http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/MeatballIsNotFree)), and potentially an avoidance of conflict resolution that is a normal and healthy part of any community. Others place it more in the realm of a radical *political* action rather than a strictly social action. Writing about the fork of OpenOffice to LibreOffice, Terry Hancock writes: 

> [In] proprietary software [a] political executive decision can kill a project, regardless of developer or user interest. But with free software, the power lies with the people who make it and use it, and the freedom to fork is the guarantee of that power. [...] The freedom to fork a free software project is [a] "tool of revolution" intended to safeguard the real freedoms in free software. {% cite hancockOpenOfficeOrgDead2010 %}

Forking digital communities can be much less acrimonious than physically-based communities because of the ability to [EnlargeSpace](http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/EnlargeSpace) given by the medium:

> In order to preserve [GlobalResources](http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/GlobalResource), create more public space. This reduces limited resource tension. Unlike the [RealWorld](http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/RealWorld), land is cheap online. In effect, this nullifies the [TragedyOfTheCommons](http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/GlobalResource) by removing the resource pressure that created the "tragedy" in the first place. **You can't overgraze the infinity.** - {% cite MeatballWikiEnlargeSpace %}

Enlarging space has the natural potential to make the broader social scene bewildering with a geyser of pages and communities, but can be made less damaging by having mechanisms to link histories, trace their divergence, and potentially resolve a fork as is common in open source software development. Forking is then a natural process of community regeneration, allowing people to regroup to make healthier spaces when needed, where the fork is itself part of the history of the community rather than an unfathomable rift.

Forking communities is not the same as forking community resources: "you can't fork a community [...] what you can do is fork the content and to *split* the community" {% cite MeatballWikiForkingOfOnlineCommunitiesa %}. As described so far, a fork divides people into unreconciled and separate communities. In some cases this makes forking difficult, in others it makes it impossible: the prime example, again, is Wikipedia. It is simply too large and too culturally dominant to fork. Even though it is [technically possible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:FAQ/Forking#Am_I_allowed_to_fork_Wikipedia?) to fork Wikipedia, if you succeeded, then what? Who would come with you to build it, and who would that be useful for? This is partly a product of its totalizing effort to be an encyclopedia of everything (what good would *another* encyclopedia of everything be?) but also the weight of history: you won't get enough long-encultured Wikipedians to join you, and you probably won't be able to recruit a new generation of them on your own. 

The last major effort to fork Wikipedia was in 2002 with an effort led by Edgar Enyedy to move the Spanish Wikipedia to The Enciclopedia Libre Universal en Español {% cite tkaczSpanishForkWikipedia2011 tkaczWikipediaPoliticsOpenness2014 %}. Though it was brief and unsuccessful, Enyedy claims that because Jimmy Wales was worried about other non-English communities following their lead, he and the other admins capitulated to the demands for no advertising and a transfer to a .org domain, among others[^jimmydisagrees]. Even a politically symbolic fork is dependent on the perceived threat to the original project, and that window seems to have been closed after 2002.

[^jimmydisagrees]: Jimmy Wales, naturally, disputes this characterization of events.

The cultural tensions and difficulties that lead other wikis and projects to fork have taken their toll on the editorship and culture of Wikipedia. The community is drawn into [dozens](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Conflicting_Wikipedia_philosophies) of conflicting philosophical camps: the [Deletionists](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Deletionism)[^AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTAD] vs. the [Inclusionists](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Inclusionism), [Eventualists](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism) vs. [Immediatists](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Immediatism), [Mergists](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Mergism) vs. [Separatists](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Separatism), and yes even a stub page for [Wikisecessionism](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikisecessionism). Editorship has steadily declined from a peak in 2007. Its relatively invisible community systems make it mostly a matter of chance or ideology that new contributors are attracted in the first place. In its calcification of norms, largely to protect against legitimate challenges to the integrity of the encyclopedia, any newcomers that do find their way into editing now have little chance to catch a foothold in the culture before they are frustrated by (sometimes algorithmic) rejection {% cite hillWikipediaEndOpen2019 halfakerRiseDeclineOpen2013 %}. 

Arguably all internet communities have some kind of [life cycle](http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/WikiLifeCycle), so the question becomes how to design systems that support healthy forking without replicating the current situation of fragmentation. Wikis, including [Meatball](http://www.meatballwiki.org/wiki/TransClusion) and [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Interwiki), as well as other projects like [Xanadu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu) often turn to **transclusion** --- or being able to reference and include the content of one wiki (or wiki page) in another. Rather than copying and pasting, the remote content is kept updated with any changes made to it. 

Transclusion naturally brings with it a set of additional challenges: Who can transclude my work? Whose work can I transclude? Can my edits be propagated back to their work? What can be transcluded, at what level of granularity, and how? While before we had characterized splitting communities as an intrinsic part of a fork, that need not be the case in a system built for transclusion. Instead relationships post-fork are then made an *explicit social process* within the system, where even if a community wants to work as separate subgroups, it is possible for them to arrive at some agreement over what they want to share and what they want to keep separate. This kind of decentralized work system resembles radical organizing tactics like affinity groups where many autonomous groups fluidly work together or separately on an array of shared projects without aspiring to create "one big movement" {% cite kleinWereDCSeattle2001 %}. Murray Bookchin describes:

> The groups proliferate on a molecular level and they have their own "Brownian movement." Whether they link together or separate is determined by living situations, not by bureaucratic fiat from a distant center. [...]
>
> [N]othing prevents affinity groups from working together closely on any scale required by a living situation. They can easily federate by means of local, regional or national assemblies to formulate common policies and they can create temporary action committees (like those of the French students and workers in 1968) to coordinate specific tasks. [...] As a result of their autonomy and localism, the groups can retain a sensitive appreciation of new possibilities. Intensely experimental and variegated in lifestyles, they act as a stimulus on each other as well as on the popular movement. {% cite bookchinNoteAffinityGroups1969 %}

To cherrypick a few lessons from more than 25 years of thought from tens of thousands of people: The differing models of document vs. thread modes and separate article vs. talk pages show us that using **namespaces** is an effective way to bridge multimodal expression on the same topic across [perceived timescales](https://communitywiki.org/wiki/TimeInWikis) or other conflicting communicative needs. This is especially true when the namespaces have **functional differentiation**[^timbldifferentiation] like the tools for threading conversations on Wikipedia Talk pages and the parsing and code generation tools of Templates. These namespaces need to be **visibly crosslinked** both to preserve the social character of knowledge work, but also to provide a means of credit assignment and tool development between namespaces. Any communication system needs to be designed to **prioritize ease of leaving** and **ease of forking** such that a person can take their work and represent it on some new system or start a new group to encourage experimentation in governance models and technologies. One way of accomplishing these goals might be to build a system around **social transclusion** such that work across many systems and domains can be linked into a larger body of work without needing to create a system that becomes too large to fork. The need for communication across namespaces and systems, coupled with transclusion further implies the need for **bidirectional transclusion** so that in addition to being able to transclude something in a document, there is visible representation on the original work being transcluded (eg. commented on, used in an analysis, etc.) by allowed peers and federations. 

These lessons, coupled with those from private bittorrent trackers, linked data communities, and the p2p federated system we have sketched so far give us some guidelines and motivating examples to build a varied space of communication tools to communicate our work, govern the system, and grow a shared, cumulative body of knowledge.

> If we can make something decentralised, out of control, and of great simplicity, we must be prepared to be astonished at whatever might grow out of that new medium.

>  A good analogy for the development of the Internet is that of
> constantly renewing the individual streets and buildings of a city,
> rather than razing the city and rebuilding it. The architectural
> principles therefore aim to provide a framework for creating
> cooperation and standards, as a small "spanning set" of rules that
> generates a large, varied and evolving space of technology.

> In building cyberinfrastructure, the key question is not whether a problem is a “social” problem or a “technical” one. That is putting it the wrong way around. The question is whether we choose, for any given problem, a primarily social or a technical solution

> Billionaires have squatted on the Magna Cum Lauded / [...]
> Methodically they plotted against those who fought it / [...] /
